        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Nicholas Matthew
          After finishing high school this June, I worked for my dad as a salesman for 3 months, and an assistant for 1 month, and now I am currently studying coding even deeper than I ever did before.
          <br>
          <strong>Hobbies</strong>
          <br>
          Some of the hobbies that I like to do are more to sports, for instance, I play a lot of badminton, basketball, ping pong, swimming, and football. I have many more sports to try so this wonâ€™t be the end of my list in the future. Apart from sports, I like to watch movies, TV series, and Anime, and play a lot of online games, more to the first person shooters like CSGO, Valorant, and Overwatch.
          <br>
          <strong>Passions</strong>
          <br>
          My passions shift from time to time, but I always have been passionate about the things I like, and I want to be good at it, so not only is sport my hobby, but it is also one of my passions. I strive to be better and lead my team if it comes to basketball, I try to improve myself every time and I am very passionate about it. I am passionate about music and playing the guitar and lastly I am passionate about whatever my responsibility
          <br>
          <strong>My projects</strong>
          <br>
          Currently, I'm not doing any projects, but in the past I've done a lot of art projects for my IGCSE exam, and a ton of music projects such as composing my own song, writing guitar tabs and notations on different software and videos of performance for my A level music exam.
